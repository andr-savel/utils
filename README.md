## Alacritty
This terminal emulator is very fast. I use it for NvimIde.
It can be tuned in the following way:
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
cd ~/.config/alacritty
cp <prefix_path>/utils/alacritty.yml .
```

## Gnome terminal
'gnome_terminal_theme' contains colors description for several themes from
https://github.com/Gogh-Co/Gogh

'DimmedMonokai_without_bright_colors' is the 'DimmedMonokai' theme without bright colors and 'cyan' color is taken from 'Afterglow' theme.
Seems this theme is the best.
